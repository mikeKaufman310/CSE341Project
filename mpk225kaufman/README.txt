CSE341 Project - Hotel California
Michael Kaufman

------------------------------------

Build Instructions:
	To run the executable, the command can be run "java -jar mpk225.jar" in the top level directory (current directory).
	In the event this does not work, the source code for the project, along with a manifest and the intended version of ojdbc jar file
	is in the mpk225 subdirectory.  This executable was produced on my personal machine, but the code was developed and tested in the 
	sunlab development environment.

Directory Structure:
	The top level directory, "mpk225kaufman" contains the "mpk225" subdirectory, the executable ("mpk225.jar") and this README
	that you are reading (lol).  In the "mpk225" subdirectory, the source code for the executable is present ("mpk225.java") as well
	as the intended version of ojdbc and the manifest for compilation.
